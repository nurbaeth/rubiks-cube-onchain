Rubik's Cube (On-Chain)  
🎯 Fully On-Chain Rubik's Cube Puzzle Game Built with Solidity 
  
Features
🧩 6 faces, 54 stickers, real 3x3 cube structure
 
🔄 Rotate any face clockwise with a smart contract call 

🎲 Scramble the cube with a random seed

✅ Check if the cube is solved
 
📜 100% on-chain — no off-chain logic or storage

🛡️ Gas-optimized and simple design

How It Works
Initialization: Each face starts with a single color.

Rotation: Rotate faces and manipulate the cube via smart contract functions.

Scramble: Randomize the cube using a pseudo-random seed.

Solve Check: Automatically validate if the cube is completed.
